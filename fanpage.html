     <h2>Bio</h2>
     <p>Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. <br/>
        The band's discography has grown to 39 albums, including 16 studio albums, 12 live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>   
        Pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. <br/>
        After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, <br/>
        including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, <br/>
        1986's Somewhere in Time, and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson <br/>
        and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and tours.<br/>
        Their 2010 studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaked at No. 1 in 28 countries and received widespread critical acclaim. <br/>
        The sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success, topping the charts in 24 countries.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>
        Iron Maiden are considered one of the most influential and successful heavy metal bands in history, with The Sunday Times reporting in 2017 <br/>
        that the band have sold over 100 million copies of their albums worldwide,[5][6] despite little radio or television support. <br/>
        The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. <br/>
        For 40 years the band have been supported by their famous mascot, "Eddie", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows. <br/>
